# Data Keep - Text-Based Information Storage Web Application

Data Keep is a web application developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) that allows users to securely store and manage text-based information. The project involves JavaScript DOM manipulations, database integration, and JWT authentication for a secure user login and signup process.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Data Keep ensures secure access with JWT authentication for user login and signup.
- **Text-Based Storage**: Users can easily store and manage text-based information through an intuitive interface.
- **MERN Stack**: Leveraging MongoDB for data storage, Express.js for server-side development, React for the frontend, and Node.js for server runtime, the project employs a robust technology stack.
- **Privacy**: Web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MongoDB are utilized to ensure the privacy and security of user data.
- **Frontend Deployment**: The frontend portion of the application is deployed on [Netlify](https://datakeep-frontend.netlify.app/).

   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd data-keep
   npm install
   cd backend 
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:
